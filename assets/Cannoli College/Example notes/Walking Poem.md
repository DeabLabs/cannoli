In quiet lanes, where footsteps tread,
A path unfolds where minds are led,
A journey starts with every stride,
Walking forth, no guide beside.

Through forests deep, where shadows dance,
A mystic walk, as if in trance,
The rustling leaves, the chirping song,
Walking here, where hearts belong.

Beside the shore, where waters meet,
A calming walk, serene and sweet,
The waves embrace the golden sand,
Walking here, hand in hand.

In city streets, alive and bright,
A walk that thrives in endless light,
The faces pass, a dance, a glance,
Walking here, a fleeting chance.

Through mountains high, a daunting task,
A walk that questions all we ask,
The summit calls, the view awaits,
Walking here, through Heaven's gates.

In life's own walk, from start to end,
A path that twists, and turns, and bends,
Each step we take, a choice, a chance,
A walking dance, life's fleeting glance.
